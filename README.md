# My Learning Log
A long list of tools, frameworks, libraries and applications which I found interesting!

## Testing

### Ava

A JavaScript test library that focuses on simplicity and lightweight design. To the point that it doesn't even have mocking built-in and it is recommended to use something like sinon.js for that. Running test concurrently is another one of its main selling points.

- [x] Open source
- [x] Free to use for both personal and business

### Jest

Open sourced by Facebook, a complete testing framework that is well crafted and packaged together. With this people very rarely would need to install any other unit-testing related packages. The framework also detects how many threads the current machine/server has and runs tests in a way that is most effecient (e.g. concurrently on multi-threaded CPUs, consecutively on single threaded CPUs).

Compared to Ava, there is no need to install sinon.js since this framework has mocking built-in and in a lot of ways is easier to use.

- [x] Open source
- [x] Free to use for both personal and business

### Pact - Consumer Driven Contract Testing

A similar to BDD approach to integration testing between backend services with either other backend services and frontend applications.

- [x] Open source
- [x] Free to use for both personal and business
