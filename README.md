## Testing

### Ava - JS unit testing library

A JavaScript test library that focuses on simplicity and lightweight design. To the point that it doesn't even have mocking built-in and it is recommended to use something like sinon.js for that. Running test concurrently is another one of its main selling points.

### Jest - JS unit testing framework

Open sourced by Facebook, a complete testing framework that is well crafted and packaged together. With this people very rarely would need to install any other unit-testing related packages. The framework also detects how many threads the current machine/server has and runs tests in a way that is most effecient (e.g. concurrently on multi-threaded CPUs, consecutively on single threaded CPUs).

Compared to Ava, there is no need to install sinon.js since this framework has mocking built-in and in a lot of ways is easier to use.
