## Testing

### Pact - Consumer Driven Contract Testing

A similar to BDD approach to integration testing between backend services with either other backend services and frontend applications.

> Pact is a contract testing tool. Contract testing is a way to ensure that services (such as an API provider and a client) can communicate with each other. Without contract testing, the only way to know that services can communicate is by using expensive and brittle integration tests.
